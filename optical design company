##### Fast-Track Your Freeform Lens Project with Yighen Ultra Precision’s Swift Prototyping Service
Time-to-market can make or break an innovation. In the field of freeform lens manufacturing, rapid iteration and fast validation are essential — especially for startups and R&D teams working on next-generation optical products. That’s why Yighen Ultra Precision offers a swift prototyping service designed to accelerate development cycles while maintaining ultra-precision standards.
#### From Concept to Prototype in Weeks
No longer do custom optical components require months of lead time. At Yighen Ultra Precision, our agile prototyping workflow enables clients to go from initial design to functional prototype in just a few weeks. The process begins with optical simulation and design optimization using Zemax and Code V, ensuring performance goals are met from the start. This is followed by direct resin processing for fast, cost-effective prototypes, and ultra-precision CNC and diamond turning to produce high-fidelity samples with nanometer-level accuracy. Every prototype undergoes comprehensive metrology validation, including interferometry and surface roughness analysis, to guarantee optical and dimensional quality. This streamlined approach not only accelerates development but also supports rapid iteration, giving engineers the flexibility to refine designs efficiently before transitioning to mass production.
#### Built for Speed Without Compromise
Speed doesn’t come at the expense of quality at Yighen Ultra Precision. Their Nano Machining Center in Singapore is equipped with advanced tools like Zygo Laser Interferometry and Wyko White Light Interferometry, ensuring that every prototype meets nanometer-level shape accuracy and surface finish requirements.
Moreover, the integration of proprietary dynamic error compensation algorithms ensures consistent results across iterations, making the prototyping phase not only fast but also highly reliable.
#### Ideal for Startups, R&D Labs, and Agile Enterprises
Whether you're developing a new AR headset, an AI-powered camera module, or a medical imaging system, Yighen’s swift prototyping service gives you the agility to test ideas quickly and confidently. It’s particularly valuable for early-stage companies looking to validate concepts before committing to full-scale tooling.
